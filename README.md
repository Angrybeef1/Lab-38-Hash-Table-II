# Lab-38-Hash-Table-II

Add an interactive menu to your Lab 37 project with these new features: print the first 100 entries; search for a key; add a key; remove a key; modify a key; and exit.

In your finished Lab 37, create a new Lab38 branch, and code this assignment on that branch.

Do not collapse/merge/pull/squash anything - just leave that branch active so I can see it.
